Task: Add more data preprocessing steps
In this task, we will explore the impact of adding more data preprocessing steps on the accuracy and generalization of our sentiment analysis model. Specifically, we will add stemming, lemmatization, and/or stop-word removal to the existing data preprocessing steps.

Files and Folders
sentiment_analysis.py: This is the main script that performs sentiment analysis on a given input text.

preprocessing.py: This script contains the existing data preprocessing steps. You will modify this script to add more preprocessing steps.

data: This folder contains the training and test data.

Instructions
Clone the repository and create a new branch for this task.

Open the preprocessing.py script and add more data preprocessing steps such as stemming, lemmatization, or stop-word removal. You can use any NLP library such as NLTK or spaCy to implement these preprocessing steps.

Train the model using the modified data preprocessing steps and evaluate its accuracy and generalization using the test data.

Update the README file with the results of the evaluation and a description of the added preprocessing steps.

Push the changes to the branch and create a pull request.

Wait for the reviewer to approve the pull request and merge it with the main branch.
